# useful commands: mutate(), summarize(), select()**, filter(), arrange(), rename()

### Questions ------------------------------------------------------------------

#  01. Load the UScereal data set in the MASS package (load the tidyverse package too)


#  02. Create a new column (using tidyverse) to get the ratio of carbs to sugars in each cereal
    
    
#  03. Summarize the distribution of sodium content in General Mills cereals


# 04. Summarize the distribution of sodium content for each manufacturer 


# 05. Subset the data so that only columns containing numerical values remain
        # hint: recall that functions may be masked by naming conflicts among packages 
       

# 06. Subset the data so that it only contains cereals with <3 g fat, > 300 mg sodium, and < 30 g carbs
   

# 07. Rearrange the data set so that cereals are grouped by manufacturer and arranged from lowest to highest protein content 
   
        
# 08. Rename the carbo column to carbohydrates
